I am a Georgia Institute of Technology student and I am now Senior in Modeling and Simulation/Network and Security. My research field is Natural Language and Data Ming. I am now work at CODA S1157A, Professor Song Machine Learning Lab and my supervisor is Weiyang Liu. I am pretty like Traveling and Anime. I used to travel to so many countries and Cities, such as Canada, Vietnam, HongKong China. It is amazing for me in the traveling trips and I hope I can visit the Japan in the 2020 Summer.

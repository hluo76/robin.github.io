Projects
======
* Feb 2019 - Present: Predict Word of Sentence 	                    
    * Used RNN to predict the word of the sentence, after the regulation and LSTM model, with 48% accuracy.
    * Plan to use GAN model to achieve the higher accuracy.
* Mar 2018 - Sep 2018: Whole Health ( Python/ MySQL/ Java / Android Studio / Swift )

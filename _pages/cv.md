Projects
======
* Feb 2019 - Present: Predict Word of Sentence 	                    
    * Used RNN to predict the word of the sentence, after the regulation and LSTM model, with 48% accuracy.
    * Plan to use GAN model to achieve the higher accuracy.
* Mar 2018 - Sep 2018: Whole Health ( Python/ MySQL/ Java / Android Studio / Swift )  
    * Made remote database and stored the data and information we need for the app; used AndroidStudio and Swift to make the app.
    * Analyzed the data which we got by Machine learning API; applied Java API to setup the function of the location finding.
* Jan 2018: Worldwide Attacking & Protection Web Project ( HTML5 / Python / MongoDB )  
    * Used HTML5 to make Worldwide Attacking and Protection web. Set up the database and scrawled the data from web.
* Jan 2019 - May 2019: Object Relational Rest  ( JavaScript/ Python / React / Redux / Django / PostgreSQL)
    * Designed and implemented a Restful API with the PostgreSQL, greatly convince the non-technology user can use the database without limitation
